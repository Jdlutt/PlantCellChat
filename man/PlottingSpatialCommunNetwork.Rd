\arguments{
\item{pcc_obj}{A PlantCellChat object.}

\item{key.signal}{A specific signal of interest (optional). If provided, filters the network based on this signal.}

\item{key.lrpairs}{A specific list of ligand-receptor pairs (optional). If provided, filters the network based on these pairs.}

\item{key.source}{A specific source cell type or node (optional). Filters the network to show communication starting from this source.}

\item{key.target}{A specific target cell type or node (optional). Filters the network to show communication ending at this target.}

\item{input.color}{A vector of colors to use for plotting (optional). Defaults to a predefined color set.}

\item{input.gradient}{A vector of colors to use for gradient fill in the circle plot (optional).}

\item{top.n}{The top N edges to display, sorted by communication strength (optional).}

\item{edge.size}{The size of the edges representing communication strength.}

\item{node.size}{The size of the nodes (cell types or spatial points) in the network.}

\item{arrow.size}{The size of the arrows on directed edges (only applicable in graph-based plots).}

\item{arrow.width}{The width of the arrows on directed edges (only applicable in graph-based plots).}

\item{edge.alpha}{The transparency of the edges (values between 0 and 1).}

\item{fig.ratio}{The aspect ratio of the figure, typically 1 for square plots.}

\item{label.cex}{The size of the labels (e.g., axis labels, legends).}

\item{title.cex}{The size of the title in the plot.}

\item{label.distance}{The distance of the labels from the circle center.}

\item{plot.type}{The type of plot to generate: "dimplot", "barplot", or "circle".}

\item{show.title}{Whether to display the title of the plot. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{coord.flip}{Whether to flip the coordinates for the bar plot (optional).}
}
\value{
A spatial communication network plot, either as a graph or a bar plot, depending on the chosen \code{plot.type}.
}
\description{
This function visualizes a spatial communication network based on a given \code{pcc_obj} (a spatial object) containing communication probabilities and related information. The network can be plotted in either a "dimplot" format (graph-based) or a "barplot" format (quantitative summary). It supports filtering based on various user-provided parameters such as specific signals, interactions, sources, targets, and others.
